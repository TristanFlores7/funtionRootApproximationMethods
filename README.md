# funtionRootApproximationMethods
This group of programs display the different methods that can be used to approximate a functions root/s.
Newtons method converges the fastest and should be used if the user has the funtion and a "good" first guess of a root.
Secant is next fastest and is helpful when the user has data points, a good first guess, but no function.
Bisection is slowest but doesn't need very accurate bounds in order to converge.
